# Bloodalyze - blood count analyzer web application tool

The app is intended to be used for early interpretation of morphological results, showing differences from the norm in graph form, presenting health tips and supplementing missing blood components. The ability to create an account will help to show the differences in results after a given period of time since previous tests. This will help subjects to keep an eye on their health. Storing the results of previous tests for logged-in users will make it easier to monitor changes that have occurred in blood composition.
